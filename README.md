# Assumptions: 

1) customers/providers choose from a fund created by the bank ( i.e the bank offers some kind of loan wether it pays it or recieves it and then the users choose the kind they want and the amount ) 
2) bank users are not allowed to register
3) reports are ready made to the bank user 
4) I assumed that the loans are paid annually and the interest is not compounded ( i.e it is fixed a 5% interest on 1000 loan is 50 annually )
5) I assumed loan applications cannot be refused
6) I assumed reports are a simple glance about the state of the system 
7) I used the company's logo and theme to design the frontend, hope that is okay
